IMP- 

Gorilla is just a wrapper around net/http, and then 
The http server implementation creates a new goroutine for each incoming request. 

Now, requests are complex beasts and could be held active for a long time, which means
it is trivial to OOM a Go http server that uses the std library naively by causing too
many goroutines to be active at the same time.

Probably will crash at 40k goroutineS
