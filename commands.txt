NOTE - Normally these two commands work, but with "go 1.13" they are not working.
1. TO run tests - "go test ./tests -v"
2. to know about coverage "go test ./tests -v - cover"

NOTE - Hence use these
go test ./... -v -coverpkg=./... -coverprofile=cover.txt
go tool cover -html=cover.txt -o cover.html
